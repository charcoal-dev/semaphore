# Charcoal Semaphore

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

Semaphore library provides a lightweight locking mechanism for the Charcoal framework, using the filesystem to
coordinate access between processes. It allows code to create, check, and release locks reliably, helping prevent race
conditions and ensuring that critical sections of code are executed by only one process at a time.

For detailed information, guidance, and setup instructions regarding this library, please refer to our official
